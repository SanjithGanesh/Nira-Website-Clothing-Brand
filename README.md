# NIRA — Clothing Brand Website ✨👗

A simple, clean **multi-page website** I built for my friend **Sandhiya**, the owner of **NIRA** (clothing shop/brand).  
This repo contains the full static site — built with plain HTML/CSS (mostly inline styles) and a few interactive UI elements.

## What’s inside

### Pages
- **Landing / Main:** `HTML/index.html`  
  Includes a navbar (with **NEW**, Home, Shop All dropdown), a brand poster section, and a **video slider**.
- **About / Brand Story:** `HTML/home.html`  
  Includes **Mission & Vision**, **Our Focus**, and **About the Founder (Sandhiya)** section.
- **Materials:** `HTML/materials.html`  
  A materials gallery page.
- **Saree Collection:** `Logo & Dox/saree-collection.html`  
  Product grid style layout with prices.

### UI highlights
- Navbar with icons for:
  - 🔍 Search (popup)
  - 🔐 Login (popup with email input)
  - ❤️ Wishlist (popup + button)
  - 🛒 Cart (bag/empty state UI)
- Lightweight static design that’s easy to extend later (add more collections, pages, products, etc.)

- It’s meant as a clean brand presence / catalog-style front-end that can be expanded later.
